function Chai() {
    return(
        <h2>chai in react</h2> 
    );
}
export default Chai;

//here the functions we are importing is component only
//so this Chai is a component
//so weather u are working with react or vite just make sure to make the name of function or the component with a capital letter
// and one more good practice is keep the name of your file starting with capital letter only
